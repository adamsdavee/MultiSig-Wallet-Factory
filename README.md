# MultiSig Wallet Factory

Welcome to the MultiSig Wallet Factory project! This blockchain-based application enables users to easily deploy and manage multisignature (multisig) wallets for various use cases, enhancing security and collaborative control over assets.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [MultiSig Wallet Factory](https://multi-sig-wallet-factory-d28a.vercel.app/)  

## Features

- **Easy Deployment**: Deploy multisig wallets with a user-friendly interface.
- **Customizable Ownership**: Define multiple owners for each wallet, specifying the number of required confirmations for transactions.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ensure that transactions are executed only after the necessary approvals, enhancing security.
- **Wallet Monitoring**: Track and monitor deployed wallets and their activities.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 LTS)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamsdavee/MultiSig-Wallet-Factory.git
   cd MultiSig-Wallet-Factory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Local Blockchain**:

   ```bash
   npm chain
   ```

   This command starts a local Hardhat blockchain instance.

2. **Deploy Contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multisig.js --network localhost "For Local Blockchain"
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multisig.js --network telos "For Telos Blockchain"
   ```

   This command deploys the multisig wallet contracts to the local or telos blockchain.

3. **Start the Frontend Application**:

   ```bash
   cd MultiSig-Wallet-Factory/Frontend
   npm start
   ```

   This command starts the React frontend application.

4. **Access the Application**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the application.

## Usage

- **Create a Multisig Wallet**:

  - Navigate to the "Create Wallet" section.
  - Enter the addresses of the owners and specify the number of required confirmations.
  - Click "Create" to deploy the wallet.

- **Manage Wallets**:

  - View a list of deployed wallets in the "My Wallets" section.
  - Select a wallet to view details, propose transactions, and monitor activities.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Located in the `Frontend` directory, built with React.
- **Contracts**: Solidity contracts are in the `contracts` directory.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Found in the `scripts` directory, used for deploying contracts.
- **Tests**: Located in the `test` directory, containing test cases for the contracts.
